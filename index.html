      <h2>About me</h2>
         <p>I am a CS undergrad at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
            I have experience in Machine Learning and Integrated Circuit Design and am always looking for more.</p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
         <h3><a href="https://github.com/BrendanL72/Hospitalization-Risk">Senior Design Project: Assessing Hospitalization Risk</a> (2022)</h3>
            <p>
               Researched several machine learning and anomaly detection methods to predict hospitalizations for clients in elderly care. 
               Best model acheived an F1-score of up to 0.924 with 90.7% of true hospitalizations caught and 94.7% of predictions correct.
               Worked closely with UTD faculty to look at new methods and refine existing ones. Was in charge of leading technical meetings and documentation.
