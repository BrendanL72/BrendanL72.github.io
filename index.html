         <h3><a href="https://github.com/BrendanL72/Hospitalization-Risk">Senior Design Project: Assessing Hospitalization Risk</a> (2022)</h3>
            <p>
               Researched several machine learning and anomaly detection methods to predict hospitalizations for clients in elderly care. <br>
               Best model acheived an F1-score of up to 0.924, with 90.7% of true hospitalizations caught and 94.7% of predictions correct.
